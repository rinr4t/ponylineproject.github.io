                <h2>Fandom</h2>
                    <p>Can you <em>really</em> talk about My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic without going into it's fandom history? There are little expandable notes detailing key events or reactions the fandom had to the plot. These will be <div class="fandom">stylised like this.</div>They're optional, but the fandom is such an essential part of MLP lore I had to include it.</p>
                <h2>Timing system</h2>
                    <p>There isn't really an in-universe dating system, so we're going to split this into two sections:</p>

                        <h4>Forming Equestria</h4>
                            <p>The inhabitants of this land are split into Earth ponies, unicorn, and pegasi. The Earth ponies farmed, and the Pegasi controlled the weather. In return for controlling the weather, the Pegasi got food. Similarly, the unicorns got food for raising the sun and moon with their magic. None of the tribes really care about each other, as long as everyone is fed. The respective rulers of each race are: </p>

                            <p>A blizzard comes one day, and creates a food shortage. This blizzard is created by three Windigos, which are ghostly horses that feed on quarrelling and disharmony, and create blizzards where they go. The tribe leaders go on a jounrey to find a new land for their people, but they all discover what will be Equestria at the same time. Their quarreling attracts the attention of the Windigos, bringing the blizzard to their newfound land. Clover the Clever recalls that Star Swirl the Bearded taught her about how Windigos work. The tribe leaders were going to freeze to death, but their wingmen Smart Cookie, Clover the Clever, and Private Pansy work together to melt the ice surrounding their leaders, creating the Fire of Friendship. Now thawed out of the ice, the three tribes agree to  live in harmony, calling this newfoundland Equestria</p>
                    <h3>Ancient equestria</h3>
                        <h4>Celstia and Luna</h4>
                            <p>Two sisters, Celestia and Luna, are crowned princesses. They go on to move into the newly built Castle of Two Sisters, and keep a journal. They meet the academic and moon/sun riser Star Swirl the Bearded, who teaches them how to do his job. Star Swirl will go on to leave them in charge of the sun and moon, giving them their cutie marks. Star Swirl will go on to teach them magic as well. Starswirl is easily the smartest magician of his era - creating over 200 spells, and having a wing in the canterlot archives dedicated to him.</p>
                            <p>Princess Amore, a <a href="https://twitter.com/KeatingRogers/status/477983361521025024">very distant relative</a> of Princess Cadence, rules over the Crystal Empire and creates the first Crystal Faire, an annual event (elaborate here please)</p>

Scorpan changes his mind however, appreciating and respecting the pony way. He betrayes Tirek, turning him in. The princesses banish him to Tartarus (what is Tartarus?)</p>
                            <p>Three sirens invade Equestria. Through their singing powers, they cause disharmony and arguing between ponies. The sirens feed on this negative energy. Star Swirl the Bearded and two of his friends, Mage Meadowbrook and Somnambula work together to stop them, and Star Swirl banishes the sirens to another world without magic. Without magic, they can't cause any harm. Right?</p>

                            <p>Luna becomes jealous of Celestia, as Equestria's ponies embrace in Celestia's day but sleep in Luna's night. She wants it to be night forever, and transofrms into Nightmare Moon, hellbent on making the night eternal.Celestia has no choice but to use the Elements of Harmony to banish her to the moon (elaborate more on here) </p>
                            <p>A young Granny Smith discovers zap apples, and founds Ponyville. The Apple family will start to have a feud with the Pear family.</p>
                            <p class= comics>Queen Chrysalis with her army of Changelings take over Timbucktu, siezing King Orion's crown. Celestia defeats Chrysalis and banishes her inside a volcano.</p>

                        <p>In a race (??), Rainbow Dash creates a sonic rainboom. This causes her cutie mark to appear, and will be the catalyst for her future friends' cutie marks.</p>
                        <li>
                            <ul>Fluttershy falls at the start of the race, but it saved by butterflies, and observes the beauty of nature around her. The sonic rainboom frightens the animals around Fluttershy, but she successfully calms them, gaining her cutie mark in the process. </ul>

                            <ul>Pinkamena Diane Pie is dissatisfied with the dull rock farming life. She is struck with happiness when seeing the rainboom, throwing her first party and gaining her cutie mark.</ul>
                        </li>
                        <p>Later, Rainbow Dash (who lives in Cloudsdale) moves to Ponyville on her Birthday.</p>

                <h3>Season 3></h3> 
                    <h4>Princess Twilight Sparkle</h4> 
                    <p class = "episodeSource">Magical Mystery Cure</p>
                        <p>Celestia sends Twilight Star Swirl the Bearded's spell book seen at the end of the first story of this season. The last page of the book is an unfinished spell, and Celestia tasks the magic prodigy Twilight with making sense of the spell. She read out the spell aloud:</p>
                        <blockquote>"From one to another, another to one. A mark of one's destiny singled out alone, fulfilled."</blockquote>
                        <p>The next day, Twilight finds Rarity, now sprouting Rainbow Dash's cutie mark, attempting to manipulate the rainclouds. When questioned about the switch in cutie marks, Rarity doesn't know what Twilight is talking about, claiming this has always been her cutie mark. She really isn't good at this though, making it rain and snow simetaneously much to Ponyville's frustration. Oh dear. Twilight goes to visit her other friends, and realises everyone's cutie mark was switched up when she read the spell aloud the night before in the same room as the Elements of Harmony: </p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <p>They all <em>suck</em> at their jobs, but believe that this has been their cutie mark for years and that this is just destiny.</p>
                        <p>There is no counter spell, and the memory-fixing spell from The Return of Harmony won't change the core identities of Twilight's friends. Twilight realises that maybe the answer lies in not trying to revert the ponies back to their original identities, but to remind them of what they mean to each other. Twilight asks Fluttershy to help out Rainbow Dash, and while hesitant at first, once she actually starts to try she's a natural. Fluttershy starts to glow, and Twilight places the Element of Kindness on Fluttershy. Realising what she is truly meant to be doing, Fluttershy remembers who she is meant to be and her cutie mark is restored. Twilight reintroduces her friends to their identities by making them help each other out, finding their true calling in the process.</p>
                        <p>Twilight realises how she needs to end Star Swirl's spell, and Twilight rewrites the spell to include the power of friendship.</p>
                        <blockquote>"From all of us together, together we're friends. With the marks of our destinies made one, there is magic without end!"</blockquote>
                        <p>When she reads the final words, the Elements of Harmony spark to life and Twilight is teleported into a etheral galaxy dimension. Celestia congratulates her, revealing that Twilight created a new form of magic, aided by friendship.</p>
                        <blockquote>destiny shit</blockquote>
                        <p>Back in Ponyville, Twilight's cutie mark with 6 instead of 5 stars hovers in the sky, floating down to the ground. As the light fades, Twilight Sparkle appears - now an alicorn and a <em>bit</em> taller.

                        <p>The next day, Twilight is crowned a princess to a crowd of hundreds in Canterlot.</p>
                <h3>Between Season 3 and 4: Equestria Girls</h3>
                    <h4></h4>
                        <p>Sunset Shimmer, a former student of Celestia's, steals the newly found Element of Magic crown. She carries it into a portal, and Twilight and Spike follow her. The portal is said to open once every (??) moons. On the other side of the portal, Twilight becomes a human. Sunset turns into a she demon... whatever... yadda... Twilight and her friends defeat Sunset Shimmer using the power of friendship, and Twilight returns to Equestria. </p>
                        <p>Three sirens see this magical explosion in the distance, and realise that there's magic in this world.</p>
                /*WHEN IS THIS TARYN?? WHAT SEASON?*/ 
                <h3>Plunderseeds!</h3>
                        <p>Remember those plunderseed vines Discord planted way back? They've grown from the Everfree forest, and have begun invading Equestria - managing to somehow capture Luna and Celestia.</p>
                        <p>Twilight and her friends return the elements of Harmony to the Tree of Harmony, destroying the plunderseeds. A chest appears within a flower.</p>
                        <p>Yup, this chest is plot relevant (elaborate here)</p>
                    <h4>The return of Tirek</h4>
                <h3>Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks</h3>
                    <p>Back in the land of Canterlot High after our <a>first movie</a>, three girls from Equestria witness the magical explosion from the first movie. They realise that there's Equestrian magic in this world, and make their way towards it. </p>
                    <p>6 moons after the explosion, Canterlot High is having a musical showcase. Sunset Shimmer is trying to redeem herself after being the school's queen bee for years, but the student body is still pretty reluctant to include her into things. Twilight's friends - the human Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity, and Fluttershy let Sunset into their circle though. Sunset spectates as her friends perform their new song. They've started a band called the Rainbooms. When playing their song, they start to have what I can really only describe as magical girl transformations but... ponified? Those who are Pegasus in Equestria grow wings, and they all have magically longer hair and sprout pony ears.</p>
                    <p>Sunset Shimmer volunteers to show some new students around - she figures she should start in their good books as her reputation proceeds her. Turns out our new students are the three girls from before: Adagio Dazzle, Sonata Dusk, and Aria Blaze. Sunset mentions the musical showcase to them, which piques their interest.</p>
                    <p>Sunset raises concerns about the girls to her friends, saying something is "off". And then, Adagio, Aria, and Sonata burst into the cafeteria into a song. Turns out these girls can like, hypnotise people with their songs through magical amulet necklaces - Sunset actually asks about the necklaces when showing them around but Adagio gets all defensive about it. This song entrances all the students into priortising the upcoming Musical Showcase, which they distort to become a Battle of the Bands. As they sing, the competitive tension grows and the students start to argue, forming green mist around themselves. The singing trio enjoy this, feeding off this negative energy - the green mist is sucked into their amulets. Sunset and her friends realise something is definitely up with these girls, being the only ones immune to this spellsong. They realise later that their immunity is related to the magic that caused them to gain pony features earlier.</p>
                    <p>It turns out <em>everyone</em> is under this spell - when Sunset and her friends try to raise concerns about the Dazzlings to Luna and Celestia, they proclaim the Dazzlings are innocent whilst having glowing green eyes. It seems that the Rainbooms and Sunset will have to deal with the girls herself. </p>
                    <p>Whilst Sunset may have been a student of Celestia's, she knows that she'll need some help. However, the portal to Equestria has been closed off. The portal isn't the only way to communicate to Equestria though...</p>
                    <p>Sunset Shimmer finds a journal that she used to write messages to Celestia to in her locker. This journal would appear as a book in Celestia's library. Maybe she could reach Twilight through here? She gives it a shot, and starts writing.</p>
                    <q>Dear Princess Celestia</q>
                    <p>Lucky for her, Twilight is studious. In a delivery of books from Princess Celestia, Twilight pays attention to one that glows and vibrates, discovering Sunset's call for help. Twilight realises what her human friends are up against. The Dazzlings are Equestrian sirens, and spellsonged ponies to turn against each other. Sirens gain power by feeding off negative energy. They were banished to another world by Star Swirl the Bearded. Twilight realises that this world must be the human world.</p>
                    <p>But the Crystal Mirror is still closed! Pinkie Pie is smarter than you think - she gives Twilight the idea that if interworld communication happened via the book, maybe the book can power the portal. Twilight engineers a workaround, using the book as a battery. Twilight wants to only take Spike - having two of everyone else would be too weird for everyone.</p>
                    <p>But like, the magic of friendship can fix everything, right?</p>
                    /*ok taryn youre not done with this unfortunately */
                <h3>Season 5</h3>
                    <h4>Uh oh, we have a communist on our hands</h4>
                            <p>In Twilight's new Castle of Friendship, the meeting room has a map of Equestria. The map shows where friendship problems are occuring - when Twilight and her friends are needed on a mission, their cutie marks glow. All of the Mane 6's cutie marks glow and floating images of them point towards somewhere on the map. The Mane 6 follow the map, and this leads them to Our Town: where all the ponies have the same cutie marks of an equal sign.</p>
                            <p>The village's founder is known as Starlight Glimmer, who advertises her town as unique and a display of "true friendship". Our Town is based off equality - um, like, stripped of individuality levels of equality. Starlight belives that when no one is special, everything is equal, and there is harmony. Starlight and the villagers invite the Mane 6 to join the town, giving up their cutie marks in the process. They refuse, but as there is a problem in Our Town they decide to stay at the town for a bit more to see whether they can figure out how to resolve the map's calling. </p>They have lunch, bickering over the controversial premise of Our Town. The (not very good, considering this town lacks talent) baker Sugar Belle overhears, and asks if their friendship is ending over this slight disagreement. They explain that conflict in natural, and Sugar Belle is intriguied by the new ideas that the Mane 6 have brought. In Sugar Belle's basement, the Mane 6 meet with Sugar Belle and her fellow townmates Party Favor and Night Glider. They admire the Mane 6's cutie marks, yeanring about their own. Eventually, they open up, revealing that Starlight uses a "Staff of Sameness" to cutie unmark ponies, apparently, it's a beautiful experience. They reveal that they're not barred from the cutie marks, and they can visit them when they wish to remind themselves of how good unmarked life is. Twilight sees this cutie unmarking as Starlight suppressing the ponies identities - and the Mane 6 make a visit to the cave.</p> 
                            <p>Starlight is happy to show them the cutie mark vault. Knowing that the Mane 6 could compromise Our Town, she takes their cutie marks, locking them away in the vault.</p>
                            <p>The Mane 6 are locked in a village house, and have lost their talents. Twilight suggests that pretending to accept themselves as fully indoctrinated in Our Town is the best solution, and they nominate Fluttershy to be the mole - everyone else had been acting suspiciously towards the village earlier. </p>
                            <p>Fluttershy is welcomed by Starlight, but only if she gives up the names of the ponies who told the Mane 6 about the cutie mark vault. Before Fluttershy can protest though, Party Favour takes the blame, insisting he was acting alone. Starlight locks him with the Mane 6 who are slowly giving in: it's a good thing Fluttershy is still out there.</p>
                            <p>Fluttershy sneaks out of Starlight's house to retrieve the Mane 6's cutie marks. She notices Starlight, and spies on her. Starlight trips over a bucket of water, which soaks her "cutie mark", revealing that her equality mark is faked with makeup.</p>
                            <p>Fluttershy splashes Starlight with water the next morning, but it doesn't get her cutie mark wet enough to show the real star swirl cutie mark. It does cause some of the makeup to run however - Party Favor comes to the rescue, and uses a rag to wipe off the rest of the makeup. Party Favor was released earlier in the morning after showing "remorse". The villagers are upset, and go to the vault to retrieve their cutie marks. Why should they live with those equal cutie marks when their own leader doesn't have one? Double Diamond shatters the vault's glass with <s>a wooden stick</s> the Staff of Sameness, and the villagers get their cutie marks back.</p>
                            <p>The Mane 6's cutie marks still lie with Starlight - at this point, Starlight has escaped through a secret passage under her bed with the cutie marks. It doesn't take long for the villagers and the Mane 6 to break into her house, find the passage, and follow Starlight in a chase throughout the mountains. She gets owned by skis and snow, and drops the jars - the cutie marks float back to the Mane 6. Starlight escapes into a network of tunnels in the mountain. The Mane 6's cutie marks glow shortly afterwards, signalling that their mission to spread friendship to Our Town is done.</p>
                        <h4>Turns out, this communist is really pissed</h4>
                        <p>Twilight enters her map room a season later to see no other than Starlight Glimmer in her throne. After giving a villian monologue, Starlight casts a spell wiht a scroll to open a portal, vanishing through it. Spike touches the scroll, and the spell activates, dragging Twilight and Spike through to Cloudsdale Flight Camp. But they haven't just travelled cities - they've travelled <em>back in time</eM> to the day Rainbow Dash pulled off a sonic rainboom, causing the Mane 6 to get their cutie marks. Starlight zaps a filly Rainbow before she can pull off the boom. Twilight realises the butterfly effect this will cause, but as she tries to ask Starlight why she would do this the time portal opens and pulls Twilight and Spike back to the future. </p>
                        <p>In the future, Twilight and her friends were not able to stop King Sombra. In the new alterned timeline, Sweet Apple Acres is a industrial capitalist processing plant, and King Sombra has enslaved the crystal ponies yet again, preparing for war against all of Equestria. The Mane 6 are now members of Celestia's army.</p>
                        <p>Twilight tries to use the scroll to travel back before Starlight can get there. But Starlight has thought this through, waiting for her to arrive back, and trapping them in crystal blocks and pushing them into the ground below Cloudsdale. Turns out the spell is programmed so if Twilight tries to use it, Starlight will arrive at the location before she does. Starlight is a smart cookie. An evil one at the moment, unfortunately.</p>
                        <p>Twilight frees herself, and tries to convince Rainbow Dash to do the sonic rainboom. In Rainbow Dash's eyes, an alicorn has asked her to do this thing she's been trying to pull off for ages - the pressure + presence of a stranger unnerves her and she flies away. Twilight is pulled back into the future again.</p>
                        <p>The timeline is different, with Queen Chrysalis being the main ruler of Equestria. Pinkie and Fluttershy, who are now part of a survivor tribe, accuse Twilight and Spike of being changelings. Zecora is able to vouch that Twilight and Spike are from a different reality - but as the tribe fight Changelings, Twilight and Spike return to the past.</p>
                        <p>This time, Twilight and Starlight go in an epic battle. However, Rainbow Dash is so mesmerised by their battling she stops racing, preventing the sonic rainboom from occuring, creating another timeline split. Twilight and Spike are pulled into the future again.</p>
                        <p>This future has Nightmare Moon rule over Equestria, with Rarity and Rainbow Dash as her knights. Nightmare Moon captures Spike after learning of Twilight's time travel, wanting to use that power to prevent the Elements of Harmony from being discovered. Twilight catches her off guard though, rescues spike, and uses Starlight's scroll to try <em>again.</em> </p>
                        <p>It fails. Lord Tirek now rules in the future. She tries again. It fails. Future Equestria runs into chaos under a  merciless Discord's rule. And again. She fails. This time, Flim and Flam become the Onceler - well not literally, but they're bulldozing down entire forests. </p>
                        <p>Twilight is determined to go in this loop forever and ever and ever - if she has a chance of saving her friends, she won't give up. Twilight realises that words or fighting won't do any good, and decides to drag Starlight into a future, hoping that what she sees will change her mind</p>
                        <p>Starlight is shocked, but doesn't believe that the world can end because of the Mane 6 not being friends. She didn't want to destroy the world - she just wanted revenge on the Mane 6. Twilight asks what shaped Starlight to be like this, and Starlight shares her story of feeling abandoned as <a href="placeholder">a filly by Sunburst, and how she thinks that friendships just lead to pain.</a></p>
                        <p>So she has to stop this rainboom. Starlight brings everyone back to Cloudsdale, preparing to rip the time travel scroll to make her changes permanent. Twilight says that her differences with her friends is what makes their friendship strong, and Starlight admits she once believed this but her differences with Sunburst tore the friendship apart. Her anger unmasks to jealousy, unmasking to sadness and some deep childhood trauma. Twilight believes in Starlight though, and believes that Starlight can overcome her past and make new friends.</p>
                        <blockquote>THEBANGINGQUOTEOFALLTIME</blockquote>
                        <p>Starlight accepts a handshake from Twilight reluctantly, and lets the Rainboom happen. The portal opens to the future, and Twilight and Starlight hug as they are pulled up. They arrive in Twilight's throne room - the original timeline has been restored. The scroll is pulled into the portal, vanishing with a flash.</p>
                        <p>Starlight apologies to Twilight first, expecting some sort of punishment. But Twilight has other things in mind, realising Starlight doesn't need punishmet - she needs guidance and help. Twilight offers to teach Starlight the ways of friendship, and Starlight accepts.</p>
